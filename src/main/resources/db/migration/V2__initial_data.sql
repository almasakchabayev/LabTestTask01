  'Divers pulled out a 65-year-old woman and, later, a man who had been trapped, CCTV said. It said four additional survivors had been found and were being rescued, but did not say whether they were still inside the overturned hull.\n Other survivors include the captain and chief engineer. Five people were confirmed dead in the accident in Hubei province Monday night during a cruise from Nanjing to the southwestern city of Chongqing, the broadcaster and the official Xinhua News Agency said.\n The overturned ship had drifted about 3 kilometers (almost 2 miles) downstream before coming to rest close to the river shore, where choppy waters made the rescue difficult. The location is about 180 kilometers (110 miles) west of the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan.'
